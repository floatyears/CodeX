# CodeX. This is going to be an awsome Game!

This source code consists three main parts.
  - Framework: Contains TCP Network, Data Model, and many Modules, such as UI, Resource Manager, Scene Manager etc.
  - Spell: An Event based spell system, very scalable.
  - UDP Snapshot: Refer to Quake3's reliable UDP solutions, and this is a C# version, with a lot of C#/C++ pointer problems solved.
  
#Finally the code has been migrated to other repo for private consideration.
Maybe someday when all the code has been finished, it will go public.
